# Ratlocker (.ratl0ck3r)

This is a prank payload created by ratcode404(.github.io). It's use is to create a fake malware, locking files but keeping settings stored for easy recovering.

The ratlocker adds ratcode file extensions, draws and sets background without the use of URLs or image download (avoid proxy blocking and detection). The original wallpaper will be backuped on \pictures\wallpaper.ratl0ck3r, so no files will be lost. The current setup only targets the files and folder structures on $HOME\Desktop\, but it could be easily extended by adjusting the path variable further down.

## Requirements:
- Windows (7/8/8.1/10)
- Unlocked device
- No internet connection or proxy by-pass is needed as the wallpaper will be created in script

## Recovering
Obviously, there is no key or tool needed to recover. All you have to do is to remove the .ratl0ck3r extention before the .original one and everything works again. The background will be stored in \pictures\wallpaper.ratl0ck3r to avoid accidential removial of any important backgrounds.
