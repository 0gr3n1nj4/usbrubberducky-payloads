# Ratlocker (.ratl0ck3r)

This is a prank payload created by ratcode404(.github.io). It's use is to create a fake malware, locking files but keeping settings stored for easy recovering.

The ratlocker adds ratcode file extensions, draws and sets background without the use of URLs or image download (avoid proxy blocking and detection). The original wallpaper will be backuped on \pictures\wallpaper.ratl0ck3r, so no files will be lost. The current setup only targets the files and folder structures on $HOME\Desktop\, but it could be easily extended by adjusting the path variable further down.
